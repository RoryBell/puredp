    <div class="content">
        <p> Welcome!<br><br>The flow of this guide has been designed with your progression in mind so you shouldn't
            need
            to skip ahead. In theory, as long as you are taking the time to implement each element as they are
            introduced, the next one that is presented to you should be the most relevant to your current needs. Of
            course, skip ahead if you want to see what's coming, but I wouldn't recommend skipping implementation
            steps.<br>While this will take genuine work, I believe this structure will give you a massive head start
            and
            will prepare you to experience what fighting games have to offer much sooner.</p>
        <p>As you progress, you will find yourself in a cycle of rapid
            improvement followed by lengthy plateus. This is the universal experience. It just means you need to add
            another tool
            to
            your kit to see that improvement again. The idea that you can finish learning a fighting game is
            madness. There is always knowledge to strive for.<br><br>Good luck, have fun!</p>
    </div>
        <button class="collapsible">Game Plan</button>
        <div class="content">
            <h3>Pure Defensive Play (PDP)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Never jump.</li>
                <li>Block low unless they jump or if you recognize an overhead attack.</li>
                <li>Only move your character with the intention of getting into the correct range so you're always ready to anti air a jump in.</li>
                <li>While the opponent is grounded, only attack if you are guaranteed a punish counter.</li>
                <li>When the opponent jumps into your space, counter with an anti air (2HP).</li>
                <li>Throw when the opponent is in range.</li>
                <li>DI is exclusively a counter measure. Never use it offensively or on prediction.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>While PDP will often lead to dull stalemate scenarios, the purpose is not to win. It's to build
                knowledge of the game's characters so you can identify punish windows, deploy the correct defensive
                options, and to learn how to recognize player patterns. In any well made fighting games, every
                action has an intended counter. If you can work out what your options are for most scenarios, your
                defense will become nearly unbreakable.
                <br>The secondary purpose of PDP is to act as an introduction to neutral and footsies via your anti
                air spacing.
            </p>
            <p>PDP is entirely about observation and reaction. While you will naturally start to see patterns and
                begin predicting the opponent's moves, acting on prediction is not a part of the gameplan.
                Only react.</p>
            <p>Don't pay attention to health bars. The points don't matter. Don't allow your decisions to be
                affected by the health bars.</p>
            <p>Your punish counters should be a normal rather than a throw. The first gameplan modifier will make
                use of this rule.</p>
            <p>At first you will find you can only punish big, high commitment specials/supers. As your knowledge of
                the character movesets increases, you will start to identify when their blocked normals are
                punishable. The first examples of this you should observe are sweeps. Finding these opportunities is
                key to learning character matchups.</p>
            <p>If the opponent gains a life lead and goes full screen for the timeout, let them. Use the time
                to practice specials/supers. Remember: you are there for your own development, not the rank
                points. The points don't matter.<br>With this mentality, you will actually climb the ranks
                faster as you will improve enough to keep the points you earn.</p>
            <p>PDP has no way to counter grapplers. This is because grapplers require prediction to beat. As
                prediction is banned...grapplers will beat you!</p>
            <p>When you feel comfortable with all the elements of this plan, pick a modifier to introduce to your
                gameplan. Only choose 1 at a time so you can focus on integrating the modifier fully.</p>

                        into a fireball. As you get more comfortable, increase the complexity. Here are
                        demonstrations of some combos. There are countless more you could learn, but these will help

                        <p>When you are comfortable with the basics combos, you can get a further extension using a
                            Super Art. These are typically used as combo enders.</p>

                            <br>A trick to make this combo easier
                            is
                            that the motion input for the light DP counts as the first quarter circle
                            for
                            the super. So after the DP just do 236K to cancel into the super like this:
<br>6236LP 236K</p>
<p>Akuma's lvl2 super is best utilised mid combo while you have the opponent in the corner. This is because it has a wall splat property which allows you to continue the combo. The lvl2 combo demonstrated below does almost the same amount of damage as the lvl3 combo, so if you have the opponent in the corner, save your resources and use the lvl2.</p>
<p>5HK link 2HP cancel 214214P link 2HP cancel 214HK <a href="https://youtu.be/4nrQAh0s5uU" target="_blank">Demo</a>
<br>To make the lvl2 input easier, it's a good idea to buffer the first quarter circle before the 2HP like this:
<br>214 2HP 14P</p>

                        <div class="content">
                            <p>To do the raging demon, you need to be at 25% health or less (same requirement for a
                                critical art. Akuma effectively has 2 critical arts).</p>
                            <p>5HK link LP LP 6 LK HP <a href="https://youtu.be/gGeKXq_qDYs" target="_blank">Demo</a></p
                                <p>A trick for an easier demon input is that it only requires 4 inputs rather than
                                5
                                <br>LP LP 6 LK+HP (LK +HP at the same time)
                            </p>
<p>As a raw demon requires whiffed normals, which can telegraph what you are trying to do, it's best to hide the inputs by performing them while doing another move. This could be an attack, a drive rush, or a jump.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Move on to the next modifier when you can do the basic combos, the lvl1 combo and the lvl3 combo consistently in a match.</p>
                </div>

                <button class="collapsible">DP Anti Air - Second Modifier</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Replace 2HP with DP for anti airing.</p>

                    <p>From the start, you were told to use 2HP to anti air. This isn't a bad option as it's a very
                        simple
                        input that provides a small amount of air invincibility and a suitably placed hitbox with
                        decent
                        damage.</p>
                    <p>Light green is a regular hurtbox, dark green is an air invincible hurtbox, red is a hitbox
                    </p>
                    <img src="akuma-cr-hp.gif" style="width:200px" loading="lazy">
                    <p>You have a better option.</p>
                    <p>Light DP instantly provides total air invincibility from frame 1. The startup is nearly
                        halved, the
                        hitbox is larger and more consistently placed throughout the move while also staying active
                        for a
                        bit longer, and the damage is increased.</p>
                    <img src="akuma-lp-shoryuken.gif" style="width:200px" loading="lazy">
                    <p>This is a significant upgrade. While it is more difficult to perform, with practise the
                        difference
                        will be negligible. Because it's air invincible from frame 1, it actually gives you more
                        time to
                        execute while eliminating concerns of getting counter hit.
                    <p>Move on when your anti airing is consistently better than when you used 2HP</p>
                </div>
                <button class="collapsible">Parry - Third Modifier</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Use parry when the opponent does a fireball, slow special, a DI when your health is too low
                        to absorb it, or a super. Parry is to be
                        used as a
                        reaction block, not a pre-emptive one. This should be your third modifier.</p>
                    <p>Parry has the same block stun as if you did a regular block. The benefits are not losing
                        drive
                        guage (you actually build drive guage when parrying hits), no wallsplat if you absorb a
                        DI, and
                        a chance at getting a perfect parry. When you perfect parry (it's a 2 frame window, so
                        very
                        difficult to do deliberately), you reset to neutral immediately but any damage you do as
                        a
                        punish counter starts with a 50% penalty. A reasonable trade off for stealing a turn.
                    </p>
                    <p>The main reason it's so important to only parry on reaction is because if you get thrown
                        while in
                        the parry state, you take +70% damage when compared to a normal throw. This happens
                        because
                        throwing a parry gets treated as a punish counter.</p>
                    <p>The recovery frames for a parry that
                        isn't in
                        blockstun add up to just over half a second. In Street Fighter, half a second feels like
                        forever.</p>
                    <p>If you have committed to a parry but think you're about to be thrown, your best option is to
                        drive rush out of the parry. This costs very little drive meter and you don't have to take
                        the full punish counter throw.</p>

                        from
                        getting struck by a meaty, and being thrown. This can be achieved in a single training
                        session using
                        the premade throwing scenario in training mode. Once you know, you know.</p>
                </div>

<button class="collapsible">Prediction - Fifth Modifier</button>
                <div class="content">
<p>Most moves in fighting games are too fast to be reacted to by a human, so a key component of high level play is making educated guesses as to what your opponent's going to do next.</p>
<p>As your knowledge and reaction times improve, you will find yourself in
                        situations where you are confident you know what the opponents next move will be. Make
                        note of when these moments occur, and how often you were right. When your predictions
                        consistently come true, ease up on the no prediction rule. Strike first! (though prediction
                        DI will almost always be a bad idea. Don't start that habit)</p>

<p>Whereas online fighting games used to be 1 and done, meaning you had to come up with generalised tactics and adapt quickly, ranked matches in street fighter 6 are best of 3. The purpose of your first game should be to collect data on the opponent so even if you lose, you have 2 more games to get the overall victory.</p>

<p>When collecting data, you need to make a mental note of how the opponent acts during common situations and what offensive tactics they try to use. Use this data to put their tactics higher up in your mental stack so you can respond faster when these situations next occur.</p>

<p>A common scenario where prediction is necessary is on wakeup. Regardless of which side of the scenario you are on, you will need to make a guess as to what the opponent will do next. Delay Tech was an introduction to this concept, but it can get far more complicated.</p>

<p>By now you will have seen opponents wake up super or wake up OD DP. Against a defensive player, such as yourself, this has proven futile. Though it may surprise you to know that it can be a viable tactic if you correctly guess the standing player will attempt to attack you on your wakeup. Make sure you know what you are doing when this situation arises. The punish you receive for getting it wrong will be devastating. Not just for your health bar, but your drive/super meter as well.</p>

<p>This is where the gameplan starts to become unrecognisable from how it was originally. It's time to go on the offensive!</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>Any cancellable normals can make use of a DRC to extend combos at the cost of 3 bars. You
                        have two
                        choices of inputs for a DRC, dash or MP+MK. For now Drive Rush is only to be used for combo
                        extensions.
                    <p>
                    <p>The move you DRC into gains additional frame advantage (the opponent will be in Hitstun for
                        longer)
                        which opens up new combo routes</p>
                    <p>Here's a simple but high damage punish combo to get you started:<br>5HK link 5HP drc 5HK link 5HP drc 5HK link 2HP cancel 214LK link 623LP cancel 236236K <a href="https://youtu.be/p6mrW1Pv1uU" target="_blank">Demo</a></p>
<p> It's important to be constantly aware of your drive guage. This will inform you of your options when starting a combo.</p>
<p>A good general rule to follow: only put yourself in burnout if you think it'll get you the win.</p>
                    <p>Long Drive Rush combos highlight how aggressive the damage scaling can be. It's impossible to
                        give a succinct guide on damage scaling, so you will need to explore this in training mode
                        or read move descriptions in <a href="https://fullmeter.com/fatonline/" target="_blank">FAT</a>
                        to discover the scaling implications of every action.
                        <br>Though it's worth pointing out that it's still optimal to use supers at the end of long
                        combos as their scaling floor is much higher than other moves (lvl1 30%, lvl2 40%, lvl3 50%)
                        which means even if you do a really long combo that brings the damage of each subsequent hit
                        down to sub 30%, finishing with a super can still deal significant damage.

<button class="collapsible">Jumping - Seventh Modifier</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>It's time to break the most important rule.</p>
                    <p>You were strictly forbidden from jumping in the gameplan, and for good reason. New players
                        quickly form the idea that jumping is a good confusion tactic. This couldn't be further from
                        the truth as you commit to a 3/4 of a second jump arc. This particular bad habit doesn't
                        leave some people. You occasionally see master ranked players non stop jumping when they
                        panic. Not because it's a good tactic, but because they struggle to unlearn it. It only
                        worked in the lower ranks where anti air tactics aren't common.</p>
                    <p>By following the anti airing element of the gameplan, you have learned that if you jump into
                        the opponent's space in neutral, you're giving them the turn.</p>
                    <p>As a grounded player that has made it this far in the guide, you should find all your actions
                        are deliberate choices. Slowly introducing jumps into your gameplan will open up new
                        gameplay opportunities.</p>

                    <li>You can finally play against grapplers! the defining part of a grapplers gameplan is to get
                        within throw range and force the opponent to guess if they will strike or command throw (a
                        50/50 mixup). jumping means you have the final tool to deal with both options.</li>
<li>You now have a way to deal with an opponent's fireballs when you are in burn out. Be mindful of your spacing and timing. With all your anti airing practise, I am trusting you to avoid fireballs safely.</li>
                    <li>You can now punish opponents who do unsafe actions while in jump range. eg. if you correctly
                        predict the opponent will throw a fireball while you are in jump range, you can hit them
                        with a forward jump attack to start a punish combo.</li>
                    <li>Combo extension. You will have noticed that when you get stunned, the opponent usually
                        starts their next combo with a jump in attack. jump in attacks as a combo starter is often
                        the way to start your highest damage combos. this is because they don't incur initial damage
                        scaling and allow you to follow up with another heavy normal as the second hit.</li>

                    <p>If you start mindlessly jumping, your Street Fighter license will be revoked.</p>
                </div>
                <button class="collapsible">Fireballs - Eighth Modifier</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Developing a decent fireball game is vital. You will need to spend time learning exactly how
                        your character's fireball options work. Primarily you will need to know, per button, how
                        fast they are and how many hits they have</p>
                    <p>Challenging an opponents fireball game is a very fast session of rock paper scissors where
                        you need to be mindful of their options as well as yours.</p>
                    <p>The main things to consider:</p>
                    <li>Do they have the drive meter to do an OD fireball? If you throw out a regular fireball, the
                        opponent's OD fireball will win and hit you.</li>
                    <li>Are they in jump in range? If you throw out a fireball and they jump, they might hit you
                        before you recover.</li>
                    <li>Does the opponent's character have projectile invincible moves? This could be used to bypass
                        your fireball and hit you. If they have a super ready, it has the potential to be
                        devastating. You will often see Cammy's using this option to hit you with their lvl3.</li>

                    <p>All lvl1 supers are vulnerable to projectiles, so if you knock an opponent down, timing a
                        fireball to be over them on wakeup while they only have lvl1 is a safe way to limit their
                        options.
                    <p>

                    <p>Avoid mindlessly throwing fireballs. It should be an informed choice.</p>

                <button class="collapsible">Drive System Counters</button>
                <div class="content">
                    <li>Parry: Throwing is your best answer. It's considered a punish counter so you will get more
                        damage
                        from a throw if you bait a parry first.</li>
                    <li>Rush: Players often abuse this to attempt skipping neutral. Simply use a light normal to
                        stop them.
                    </li>
                    <li>Impact: This requires the most situational awareness to respond to. If you are cornered, you
                        are at
                        risk of wall splat. If you are cornered and burned out, you are at risk of getting stunned.
                        Your
                        options are:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Counter Drive Impact. Make sure you have enough health to absorb the initial hit
                            </li>
                            <li>Parry. Unlike regular blocking, you won't get wall splat if you parry. you also have
                                a
                                chance to perfect parry to steal the turn</li>
                            <li>Throw</li>
                            <li>Armour Break either manually by doing a fast 3 hit combo, or by using an armour
                                breaking
                                move such as a super</li>
                        </ul>

                <div class="content">
                    <li>Watch your replays. There is no better way to work out where you can improve than by
                        watching your gameplay without the responsibility of execution. Make notes on the good and
                        the bad so you can build an understanding of your habits.
                        <br>Play along with the replay in your mind. See if your decision making is any different
                        when you don't feel pressured.
                    </li>
                    <li>Learn the rest of your main character's moves. This will be the most time intensive task,
                        but slowly building a full understanding of your character's toolkit will open up punish and
                        combo opportunities. Integrating the moves one at a time will enable you to understand the
                        intended use case for each move.</li>
                    <li>Drive Rush Counter. When the opponent tries to drive rush, use a light normal to hit them
                        first.
                    </li>
                    <li>Advanced spacing. When you start to understand the character's maximum strike range, adjust
                        the movement rule in the gameplan so you are always JUST outside of your opponent's strike
                        range.</li>
                    <li>Whiff punish. When you can consistently stay just outside of the opponent's strike range,
                        react to their button with a button of your own to punish.</li>
                    <li>Use of a fast normal when the opponent tries to walk into your space (normally a crouching
                        medium
                        attack).</li>

                    <p>When you are able to use this gameplan to consistently win the interactions it's intended
                        for, while also applying the modifiers, you will find you already have the understanding you
                        need to go on the offensive. At this stage, you can start to relax the rules of this
                        gameplan and start to create your own. This is where fighting games really begin!</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>HA! Got you! This is the frame data section!</p>
                    <p>Knowledge of frame data serves two main
                        purposes</p>
                    <li>Punish Counters. If an opponent's move whiffs, you can see how long you have to get in with
                        an
                        attack. Or if you block an attack, you can know if you get out of Blockstun before they
                        finish their
                        recovery, providing a window to start your turn.</li>
                    <li>Combos. Having a database of the startup, cancel types (can it cancel into a special?
                        super?), and
                        Hitstun for all moves trivialises building combos.<br>Choosing a move to initiate an attack
                        can be
                        greatly informed by the combo routes you learn to maximise your damage output. Optimising
                        for the
                        most common scenarios means you will need to win fewer interactions to win a round.</li>
                    <p>If you want to improve your knowledge fast, the best way is to utilise frame data tools. The
                        barrier
                        to entry is so much lower than it may seem.</p>
                    <p>Keeping a log of moves you struggled to deal with can prove invaluable. Pairing this log with
                        a frame
                        data tool such as <a href="https://ultimateframedata.com/sf6/" target="_blank">Ultimate
                            Frame
                            Data</a>, which has a gif of each move, along with visualised hitboxes and frame data,
                        to help
                        you identify a way to counter a particular move. This eliminates the much slower trial and
                        error
                        phase.</p>
                    <p>Frame data may seem a needlessly nerdy rabbit hole, but if used correctly, your time spent
                        accessing
                        frame data tools is very brief. You have a specific question you want answered, go in, get
                        the
                        answer, get out. The upfront intimidation from all the information will fall away when you
                        realise
                        how much faster it makes learning character matchups and your own character.</p>
                    <p>Trying to store all of the data in your head is a waste of time. Use frame data tools to
                        answer
                        specific questions as they arise, and over time you will build an intuitive understanding of
                        all
                        character's strengths and weaknesses</p>
